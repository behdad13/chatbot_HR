# chatbot_HR

Welcome to HRGPT, the GPT-based chatbot that generates detailed job descriptions for tech and data-related departments. The chatbot will ask you a series of questions about the job and generate a job description accordingly. HRGPT is powered by the OpenAI API.

To deploy this project in a production environment, we have created a Flask app and dockerized it for standardized deployment.

To run the app, simply execute the Docker image in your integrated development environment (IDE) and run it on your local host. Before doing so, please ensure that you have added your OpenAI API credentials in the `app.py` file.

If you prefer, you can also utilize AWS ECS to run the Docker image and connect it to your HTTPS domain, allowing you to use it within your company.
